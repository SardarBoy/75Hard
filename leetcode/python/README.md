*Currently Solved* - 

**Group Anagrams** – Learned to use hash maps to group strings by sorted characters. Got to know about defaultdict(list) which automatically initialises dictionary entries as empty lists

**Remove Element** – Practiced in-place array manipulation using two pointers.

**Two Sum** - Importance of dictionaries for fast lookup

**Majority element** - Learnt logic behind Boyer Moore Voting Algorithm - majority element occurs more than half the time & non majority element will cancel out in the end

**Merge sort** - Learned the divide and conquer approach, getting time complexity to O(nlogn) compared to other sorts

**Sort Colors** – Learned the Dutch National Flag problem , in place array manipulation, one pass algorithm with constant extra space.

**Top K Frequent Elements** - Learnt Bucket sort- grouping elements by frequency, and how to implement in O(n) time
