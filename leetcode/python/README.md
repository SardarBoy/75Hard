**Majority element** - Learnt logic behind Boyer Moore Voting Algorithm - majority element occurs more than half the time & non majority element will cancel out in the end

**Merge sort** - Learned the divide and conquer approach, getting time complexity to O(nlogn) compared to other sorts

**Sort Colors** – Learned the Dutch National Flag problem , in place array manipulation, one pass algorithm with constant extra space.

**Top K Frequent Elements** - Learnt Bucket sort- grouping elements by frequency, and how to implement in O(n) time

**Missing number** -  Used mathematics - formula to find sum of natural numbers (n*(n+1))//2

**Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock I** -  Understood how to do it in single pass, by tracking lowest price so far
